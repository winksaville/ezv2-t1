The project uses tokio for async operations, rumqttc for MQTT, sqlx for database access, and tracing for logging\n4. Key features include dynamic log level configuration via file watching and JSON parsing of telemetry messages\n\nI have access to tools for:\n- **Glob**: Finding files by pattern\n- **Grep**: Searching file contents with regex\n- **Read**: Reading specific file contents\n- **Bash**: Read-only operations only\n\nI'm ready to help with your search requests.
